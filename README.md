# NodeJs Task 1

## NodeJS

- Node.js is an _open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment_ that allows developers to `run JavaScript code outside of a web browser.`
- It is designed to be **efficient and scalable**, making it well-suited for `building server-side` and `networked applications.`
- **Node.js is built on the V8 JavaScript engine,** the same engine that powers Google Chrome, and it uses a `non-blocking,` event-driven architecture that makes it ideal for handling _asynchronous tasks_ and I/O operations.
